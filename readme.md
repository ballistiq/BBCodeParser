# BBCodeParser

This is a lightweight BB Code Parser. It is designed to be no-nonsense. It just parses a string, replaces all the BB code and returns an HTML string.

This was extracted from a recent project where we had to import all old forum data from VBulletin. This might not be the canonical BBCode list, but we covered all the major tags that were being used. If you add more tags, please fork and do a pull request so that we can put it all in here.

# Usage

Include bbcodeparser.php

To parse a string simply go:

	$output = BBCodeParser::parse($input);
	
It really is that simple. :)

# Configuration

You can configure the web path to smilies, and custom smilies.

# License

This uses the MIT license. It's free. Use it. But please, if you do modify, fork, modify and do a pull request. Thanks. :)
